I'm using Ball jars for pantry storage and purchased these labels with that in mind, having read the reviews about just how quickly moisture breaks them down. I was able to write on them with both fine and regular felt-tipped markers, testing for ink bleeding issues on a label that was cut in half during production. The labels were very dry and cool (it was near-freezing out and they'd just been delivered!) so that may have been a factor in their performance. They adhered well to the jars, and I had no problems with the backing sticking to the roll. To test how quickly the labels break down, I stuck the cut-in-half one I was using for ink tests onto the side of a drinking glass, pressing to make sure it was firmly adhered, then ran water over it. I was able to scrub away the label and all of the adhesive with my bare fingers! So far this product seems to be exactly what I was looking for.",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"L. A. Stanley","content":"I was nervous ordering these after reading the other review. But after the seemingly endless scraping necessary to remove the regular labels from jars, (and still leaving sticky, unsightly adhesive residue behind) this was a really appealing concept. So, I took a chance and ordered them.I did not have the problems the other reviewer had - my labels separated easily from the roll and adhered nicely to the canning jars. (I did make sure that my jars were completely dry and at room temperature before I applied the labels.) I have not had the labels long enough to assess whether they will remain stuck for the long term, but after a couple of weeks they are still firmly attached. I have not yet needed to wash a jar that has a full label on it. However, there was a half-label at the beginning of the label roll. As a test, I stuck this half-label on a glass before putting it in the dishwasher. After the dishwasher was finished, there was no trace of the label on the glass or elsewhere in the dishwasher - it seems to have dissolved as advertised.The labels are a little absorbent, so if you are using a felt-tipped marker to write on the labels, the ink will \"bleed\" slightly. This is a slight cosmetic problem; the bleeding is not bad enough to affect legibility. You can write on the labels with pencil or ballpoint pen to avoid the bleeding problem.If I discover any additional problem with these labels in the future, I will update my review. But so far I am very pleased and intend to keep ordering them.UPDATE: The labels are still sticking just fine. I have now used and washed some of the jars I used these on. The labels have always come off completely in the dishwasher without leaving any gunk behind.There have been more negative reviews posted since I wrote my original review, so maybe quality control is erratic? But given the great results I've had with mine, I'll risk it and order some more when I run low on these.A couple of things to note: I don't store my unused labels in the kitchen. I keep them in a closet elsewhere in the house, so they aren't exposed to the day-to-day heat and humidity of the kitchen. I only bring them into the kitchen when I am ready to use them. Also, I don't put the labels on my jars until they've cooled overnight. By this time, all the heat and humidity from the prior day's canning session has cleared out of the kitchen. If I can more than one day in a row, I label and put away the previous day's jars first thing in the morning - because I need the counter space! So again, my labels are not spending time in a hot and humid kitchen. I wonder if that's why I'm not having the problems other people are having. It makes sense that a dissolvable label would perform badly in a hot and humid kitchen.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-07-22 16:56:11"},{"user":"Lindsey M","content":"I bought this item as a gift for my husband about 10 years ago; it stayed in storage because although he has been interested in canning, we are finally living in a house and have a garden and can now grow our own vegetables. So we got out the storage box these labels had been sitting in, and they are still useable. These labels dissolve easily. Pleased with this product.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-16 16:56:11"},{"user":"jenswrens","content":"I use canning jars for almost everything - not just canning, although I do can tomatoes once a year.I never liked labeling my jars because I use them so often for different things (storing dry foods in pantry, leftover sauces in refrigerator, bone broth in freezer, etc.), and I truly hate removing sticky labels from anything (hello goo gone!).So I would just use a sharpie on the glass, which usually smudged and was hard to read.These labels are easy to apply to the jar, stick well, and dissolve and wash off in the dishwasher or by hand washing.They leave no residue at all.They also last well on the jar. They don't come unstuck prematurely, even on my refrigerated or frozen jars.Contrary to other reviews, I have had no problems at all with the labels not being sticky.I haven't refrigerated them prior to using or anything.I used them right away, immediately out of the Amazon box, and they were perfect then and are still perfect now.I store them in a regular drawer in the kitchen.It would be nice to have some different designs/colors to choose from.I will definitely be buying these again!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-12-06 16:56:11"},{"user":"Sarah H.","content":"I've used different brands, none are close to the quality and clean dissolvability as these Ball brand labels!Really good paper and lovely design gives them charm.Others don't stick or won't come off, peel up, ink transfers and rubs, or too small to write what you need on the jar.I try cheaper labels, and always end up back with Ball jar labels, they're worth it!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-10-06 16:56:11"},{"user":"dawna","content":"For a very long time I used various stickers and labels to mark my canning jars, and I always hated trying to get the residue off after using the contents and getting my jar ready for the next fill.These labels are really pretty, adhere really well, AND... wash off without having to get out special solvents.Just hot, soapy water, and it goes away!I tend to pull out how ever many labels I'll need to label a batch of whatever shortly after they come out of the canner, and I wait to apply them after they have cooled, the seal is assured, and I've washed the jars.It's nice to have them ready to go as soon as they are dry again!They really are pretty with plenty of room to write on them.I always add the date of canning as well.I like to display my canned goods in my glass shelves, and the uniformity of the labels looks great!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-08-07 16:56:11"},{"user":"Jennifer Wilson","content":"Classy, simple, elegant.These disappear in the wash.As home canners, and brewers, my husband and I recycle bottles and jars endlessly.This seasons jam might contain next seasons beans.Label residue has been the bane of my existence for many years.I like them so well, that I use them to label other things, like home made cleaning products, and cover them with clear contact paper (which is also easy on residue) to make them last until I want them to come off.This product completely disappears in the dishwasher or the sink, leaving no tell tale residue behind, making my life a little easier.As a side note, I live in a VERY dry climate and I can imagine that heavy sweating in a more humid environment could possibly dissolve this off of say a jam jar pulled from the fridge during breakfast on a warm/hot humid day.This product exceeded my expectations when I first bought them and I have continued to use them for about three years now.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-10-27 16:56:11"},{"user":"Motly Crew","content":"Great in theory but I still use my Sharpie.

The labels are nice, easy to write on, lay down and stick very well to jars - and last through freezing and refrigeration without deteriorating. I've had these labels since Christmas, and I just washed my first jar with a label on it. It had been placed on jar 4 months ago and had been in the refrigerator all that time. The label still looked new. I'd used a fine tipped sharpie to write on the label. What really impressed me was, as I rinsed the jar out to put in dishwasher, the label instantly dissolved. Paper and glue were gone in seconds with a little soap and warm water and a very light rub. I'd given most of my labeled jars away to friends and family so I hadn't washed one before. I will buy these again!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2018-05-31 16:56:11"},{"user":"JMW","content":"These are the only labels I use because they are so perfect! They really do come off in the dishwasher cleanly (no glue residue) but they also hold up well after being applied. Not flimsy and they don't break when writing on them. I found a 3 year-old jar in the cupboard and the label is still stuck on completely. I always apply them the next day after my processed jars are completely dry and have come to room temperature. I only once had trouble getting some labels off the roll, and I realized it was because the box was leftover from the previous season and it seemed the labels dried out a little. Now I just keep the leftover wax paper rolled around instead of tearing it off, and if I'm keeping a box leftover for the next year I put it in a plastic bag. I've never had another issue.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2017-05-05 16:56:11"},{"user":"Maria C.","content":"These labels are great! I'm using Ball jars for pantry storage and purchased these labels with that in mind, having read the reviews about just how quickly moisture breaks them down. I was able to write on them with both fine and regular felt-tipped markers, testing for ink bleeding issues on a label that was cut in half during production. The labels were very dry and cool (it was near-freezing out and they'd just been delivered!) so that may have been a factor in their performance. They adhered well to the jars, and I had no problems with the backing sticking to the roll. To test how quickly the labels break down, I stuck the cut-in-half one I was using for ink tests onto the side of a drinking glass, pressing to make sure it was firmly adhered, then ran water over it. I was able to scrub away the label and all of the adhesive with my bare fingers! So far this product seems to be exactly what I was looking for.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-01-16 16:56:11"}];
