			var commentsList = [{"user":"Fadi Shamaan","content":"I recently purchased it, and I must say, I\u2019m thrilled with my decision! First off, the size is perfect \u2013 it\u2019s massive, really. I was looking for a jar that could hold a decent amount of veggies for pickling, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The 79 oz/2350 ml capacity is just the right amount for fermenting my homemade pickles, and I\u2019ve even used it to store some bulk dried fruits, and I can tell you this jar is a solid piece of kitchen equipment. The glass is sturdy and thick, so it doesn't feel like it\u2019s going to crack or break just by looking at it. Plus, the clear glass lets you see exactly what\u2019s inside, which is perfect for when I\u2019m checking on my pickles or whatever else I\u2019m fermenting without having to unscrew the lid and risk letting air in. The silicone gasket on the lid is an absolute game-changer; I didn\u2019t realize how important that feature was until I used it. I\u2019ve had issues with other jars in the past where the lid wasn\u2019t tight enough, leading to leaks or even worse, ruining my food by letting in air. With this one, there\u2019s no such issue \u2013 it creates a perfect seal every time. The airtight nature is a huge bonus because it helps preserve whatever I put in it for way longer than usual, and trust me, I\u2019ve tested it with pickles, kimchi, and even some homemade jam. Not to mention, it\u2019s super easy to clean. I just rinse it out with soap and water, and it\u2019s good to go. Now, about the scale marks \u2013 they\u2019re super helpful for measuring ingredients or liquid if you\u2019re doing canning or fermenting. I\u2019m one of those people who always forgets how much I put in, so it\u2019s great to have those little markers right there, especially when I\u2019m following recipes that require precise measurements. The lid fits tightly, and I have yet to see any leaks, even when the jar is tipped over accidentally (don\u2019t judge me, I\u2019m clumsy). Also, it looks nice sitting on my kitchen counter. Some jars just look... well, kind of plain or tacky, but this one has a nice, clean, modern look to it, which makes it easy to leave out on display without worrying about it clashing with the rest of the kitchen. I also want to mention how heavy-duty it feels. I\u2019ve had a couple of jars in the past that were too flimsy, and they cracked pretty easily, but not this one. It's built to last. Honestly, I feel like I could drop it from a few feet, and it\u2019d be fine (but I\u2019m not going to try that). I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable, practical jar for all kinds of food storage, whether you're into fermenting, pickling, or just storing dry goods. The airtight seal is so effective that I\u2019m tempted to get a few more for long-term storage, especially with the holidays coming up. It\u2019s versatile, durable, and well worth the price. A solid purchase if you ask me!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-04 16:56:11"},{"user":"Madhu Mohan","content":"I recently received the 1 Pack Glass Storage Jar with Lid (79 oz/2350 ML) for my home canning and pickling needs, and after several weeks of use, I can confidently share my experience.Design and Build QualityThe first thing that caught my eye was the impressive build quality. The jar is made from thick, durable glass that feels heavy-duty and well-made. The glass is clear, allowing you to easily see the contents and monitor the pickling or fermenting process. The lid is also solid and comes with a silicone gasket that ensures a tight, airtight seal. This is crucial for fermenting and pickling to prevent contamination and ensure proper preservation.FunctionalityThe jar comes with a scale mark, which is incredibly handy for measuring liquids and tracking the progress of your fermenting projects. The 79 oz/2350 ML capacity is perfect for larger batches of pickles, kimchi, or even homemade sauerkraut. I've used it for both pickling cucumbers and fermenting kimchi, and it has performed exceptionally well in both cases.Airtight SealOne of the standout features of this jar is its airtight seal. The silicone gasket works perfectly, ensuring that no air gets in or out once the lid is closed. This is particularly important for fermenting, where an airtight environment is necessary to prevent spoilage and ensure proper fermentation. I\u2019ve had no issues with leaks or odors escaping, which speaks volumes about the effectiveness of the seal.Ease of Use and CleaningThe wide mouth of the jar makes it easy to fill and clean. I appreciate that it is dishwasher safe, although I usually wash it by hand to maintain its clarity and integrity. The wide opening also makes it easy to pack vegetables tightly when pickling, which is a nice plus.VersatilityWhile I primarily bought this jar for fermenting and pickling, it's versatile enough for a variety of uses. It\u2019s great for storing dry goods like beans, pasta, or rice, and the airtight seal keeps everything fresh. I\u2019ve even used it to store homemade cookies and granola, and they stayed fresh for weeks.Pros:High-quality, thick glass: Feels durable and sturdy.Airtight seal: The silicone gasket ensures no air or moisture gets in.Scale mark: Helpful for measuring and monitoring.Versatile: Suitable for fermenting, pickling, canning, and general storage.Wide mouth: Easy to fill, pack, and clean.Cons:Heavy: Due to its thick glass, it\u2019s a bit on the heavy side, which might be an issue for some.Single pack: It would be nice if there were options to buy in a multi-pack for those who do a lot of canning.Overall VerdictThe 1 Pack Glass Storage Jar with Lid is an excellent investment for anyone interested in fermenting, pickling, or canning. Its durable build, airtight seal, and versatility make it a valuable addition to any kitchen. Despite being a bit heavy, its benefits far outweigh this minor drawback. I highly recommend this jar for both beginners and experienced canners alike.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-26 16:56:11"},{"user":"TD","content":"This review is for the 1 Pack Glass Jar with Lid, 79 oz/2350 ML Glass Cookies Jar with Lid and Scale Mark, Glass Storage Jars with Lids, Airtight Pickle Jar w Silicone Gasket for Fermenting, Pickling, Canning.This a really nice heavy duty jar made of totally clear thick glass with a nice heavy duty screw on plastic lid.

For long-term storage it's just the healthier method and I simply wish I could afford more glass jars to store all of my dry goods. I buy a lot of rice in large bags and usually immediately transfer it to glass. I used this jar for exactly that - it now holds a large amount of my brown rice. It's heavy and strong. I like the measurement lines on the side. The lid is firm fitting, not warped or questionable of quality, and it creates a good seal so I'm not worried about bugs getting into my rice. The price for this is a bit on the high side in my opinion - I wish I could afford more of them.
