We don't do enough volume of these products to warrant spending the money on an automatic labeling machine, so we've been doing these by hand for a while now. A couple of the PET bottles that we have on hand do not have seams, and when you're working with a 7\" wide label that needs to wrap around a jar and meet up perfectly on the other side, this can be a huge challenge.Thankfully isopropyl alcohol removes our labels after a bit of soaking, but I still got tired of all the label wasting as a result of all the do-overs we had to do to make everything look right for display. I started to think of ways I could rig a contraption to help me keep a consistent angle so the labels would line up properly every time. A little later I found myself online looking for something else we needed and this Label Ledge device appeared under one of the item recommendation sections Amazon traps you with - obviously I clicked it and ended up placing an order.As it turns out, this product does exactly what we needed it for. It is extremely simplistic, which at first makes you subconsciously feel like the price is a bit excessive for what it is, but the product is one of the extremely rare ones actually made (not just \"designed\" or \"assembled\") in the United States and it's produced by what appears to be an actual small company who puts personal care into their products and services and not a faceless corporate entity accountable only to shareholders.As a small business owner myself, this immediately stood out to me as a huge selling point and I'm happy to have made the purchase. On top of that, there's no way anyone could mistake this for a cheap product in terms of materials. It's super heavy given the dimensions and might even be able to stop a bullet (don't try that) from the way it feels. As long as we don't lose it in a move or something, I see no reason this device won't last us forever quite honestly.Anyone with even the slightest bit of common sense can set this up in seconds, but they provide instructions in the box and there are videos online as well. We're using this with sheet labels and it's working great on all of our bottles. I feel good about this purchase and would recommend it for any application, even commercial use.","purchase_model":"Color: Cloud White Color: Cloud White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-08-29 16:56:12"},{"user":"JAG","content":"I was nervous about this purchase, but I\u2019m incredibly happy with this product! It is absolutely phenomenal quality, workmanship and design. It\u2019s heavy duty. It does not move when you set it on the counter. It\u2019s also extremely easy to adjust for any size bottle or jar. For the money, this is of great value.I set my jar upright here in the picture so you can see the label is perfectly straight. It was so easy to adjust and use.","purchase_model":"Color: Cloud White Color: Cloud White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-06 16:56:12"},{"user":"Nicole Schlicher","content":"I absolutely love this tool!

Not only is it built better, but it can label larger and smaller bottles than the other one can. Glad to see this level of craftsmanship. No sharp edges, everything fits together nicely, and it collapses down to almost nothing. And it looks like the white coating has been powdercoated onto the metal, but don't quote me on that. The fact is that the white ain't coming off. This, in my book, was money well spent.","purchase_model":"Color: Cloud White Color: Cloud White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-09-05 16:56:12"},{"user":"Matt R.","content":"I looked at a couple other types, but this one spoke to me. Not literally. That would mean I'm crazy. :-P But other models are made of wood and although they may be just fine, I have concerns that any hand constructed wood device could be off center in some way and being off by even 1/16\" can really screw up label placement.So - when seeing this, I knew it was fabricated with precision laser cuts and bends which means perfect alignment.So with that in my head, I got it, I used it, I love it! Worth every penny. Don't complain about the price. Using the right tools to do a job is priceless.It's easy to assemble. It's heavy and solid. It's worth it. Makes applying labels so much easier, faster and accurate.
